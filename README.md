# js-basic-fundamentals


## Overview

ğŸŸ¢ Hello friends, Iâ€™ve been learning HTML and CSS for about a month.
 I am extremely motivated and study routinely every day.I pick things up rapidly, 
 which makes me really happy.

ğŸŸ¢ Furthermore, I do website markups daily and intensively. 
 I share my progress through these posts and try to be active on LinkedIn.
 Furthermore, I decided to simultaneously learn JavaScript on javascript.info

ğŸŸ¢ Today I started to learn the fundamentals.
 I know thereâ€™s still a lot more to learn,
 but I want to share my step by step growth here. âœŠğŸš€ğŸš€
